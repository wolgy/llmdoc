# /llmdoc:update

Use this command after a task when the tracked project knowledge, workflow guidance, or doc structure should be updated.

The goal is not to archive everything the task discovered. The goal is to keep tracked `llmdoc/` docs consistent with the current repository while staying smaller than the source code or adding architectural explanation the source cannot provide by itself.

Change detection is **commit-based**: it is anchored on a durable watermark (`llmdoc/state/sync.md`) recording the last source commit already reflected in `llmdoc/`, not on the working tree or the date. Uncommitted changes are an additional input; they never move the watermark.

Before executing the workflow, load the `llmdoc` skill.

Why:

- the skill defines what belongs in `must/`, stable docs, and memory
- the skill explains update modes, memory handling, and process-signal triage
- this command should focus on orchestration, not re-explain the whole system

Invariants, design rationale, and verified git semantics: `llmdoc/architecture/update-orchestration.md`.

## Sync State

`llmdoc/state/sync.md` is a tracked, machine-managed markdown file holding one load-bearing field, `watermark-commit` (the full commit SHA, whatever hash the repo uses — SHA-1 or SHA-256). It is not project knowledge: never index it, never add it to `startup.md`/`must/`, never count it as active memory. Read the watermark with a single anchored line:

```sh
W=$(awk -F': ' '/^- watermark-commit:/{print $2}' llmdoc/state/sync.md 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')
```

`recorder` is the only writer of `sync.md`, and only advances it as the terminal step of a successful update (see Watermark Advance).

## Change Detection (commit range)

Run all git plumbing without `set -e` (capture each exit code) so a `128` degrades instead of aborting. The resolution ladder order is an invariant — never reorder:

```sh
# 1. Capability probe (gates the whole ladder — steps 2-5 assume a git work tree)
[ "$(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null)" = true ] || {
  echo "non-git: watermark inactive"   # STOP HERE: use legacy working-tree + staged + summary detection;
  return 0 2>/dev/null || exit 0        # do NOT run steps 2-5, do NOT read or advance the watermark
}
SHALLOW=$(git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository)
H=$(git rev-parse HEAD)                                  # capture once

# 2. Read watermark
W=$(awk -F': ' '/^- watermark-commit:/{print $2}' llmdoc/state/sync.md 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')

# 3-4. Resolve RANGE_BASE with EXPLICIT branching. Existence gates reachability: never run merge-base
#      on an empty/missing $W — it would fatal-128, not skip. Each branch is terminal.
if [ -z "$W" ]; then
  echo "watermark empty/missing → first-run: base=HEAD (no backfill unless --from/--since), force ≥ analysis, seed at HEAD on success"
  RANGE_BASE=$H
elif ! git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$W^{commit}" >/dev/null; then
  echo "watermark object missing (GC'd / below shallow boundary) → first-run baseline=HEAD, warn, do NOT advance"
  # if $SHALLOW = true, suggest: git fetch --unshallow. (rev-parse --verify --quiet exits 1 cleanly; cat-file -e "$W^{commit}" would fatal 128 on the peel.)
  RANGE_BASE=$H
elif git merge-base --is-ancestor "$W" "$H"; then
  RANGE_BASE=$W                                          # watermark valid
elif git merge-base --is-ancestor "$H" "$W"; then
  echo "HEAD BEHIND watermark → REFUSE (reverse W..HEAD would list future files as deletions and strip docs); working-tree input only, do NOT advance"
  RANGE_BASE=$H
else
  RANGE_BASE=$(git merge-base "$W" "$H")                 # true divergence (rebase/squash-merge); force ≥ analysis
fi

# 5. Net change set (rename-aware, NUL-safe). In -z mode a rename/copy record is STATUS\0OLD\0NEW\0
#    (3 fields; STATUS is R<score>/C<score>); a normal record is STATUS\0PATH\0.
git diff --name-status -M -C -z "$RANGE_BASE" "$H"
```

Batch flags (if any of `--range/--commits/--since/--from` is given, the default `RANGE_BASE..HEAD` is NOT added unless `--include-default`). Each batch resolves to a set of changed **paths**: parse the `--name-status -z` records — drop the status column; in `-z` mode a record is `STATUS\0PATH\0`, but a rename/copy record (status `R<score>`/`C<score>`) is `STATUS\0OLD\0NEW\0`, so read TWO path tokens when the status starts with `R` or `C` (take both) and one otherwise, or the parser desyncs. Union all batch path-sets with the working-tree set, deduplicated (do not `sort -u` raw NUL/status records):

- `--range A..B` (repeatable): `git diff --name-status -M -C -z A B`.
- `--commits SHA,…`: per commit `git diff --name-status -M -C -z <sha>^ <sha>`; **reject merge commits** (parent count > 1 → tell the user to pass `A..B`); **root commit** diffs against the empty tree `git hash-object -t tree /dev/null` (`4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904`).
- `--since REF|date`: for a ref, `<ref>..HEAD`; for a date, resolve a boundary commit `B=$(git rev-list -1 --before=<date> HEAD)` and diff `B..HEAD` with the same `git diff --name-status -M -C -z` as every other branch. If `B` is empty (no commit predates `<date>`, so the whole history is in range), diff against the empty tree `git hash-object -t tree /dev/null` instead of `B..HEAD` (which would be `..HEAD` and fatal). Do NOT `git log --name-only`, which yields a statusless, blank-line-polluted shape that will not union cleanly.
- `--from SHA`: one-off start override for this run only; does not touch `sync.md`.
- `--working-tree-only`: skip the committed range entirely; document only uncommitted changes; never advance the watermark.

Always fold in, as an ADDITIONAL input tagged `worktree` (never advances the watermark): `git diff --name-only HEAD` (every tracked path whose on-disk content differs from HEAD — staged and unstaged) ∪ `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (untracked). `git diff --name-only HEAD` already covers staged changes, so a separate `--cached` diff is redundant.

Empty range (already synced) — applies ONLY when the watermark was VALID (the `RANGE_BASE=$W` branch) and `W == HEAD`: if there are also no working-tree changes and no batch flags, report `already up to date through <Hshort>` and exit without touching docs, the index, or the watermark. The degraded branches that force `RANGE_BASE=HEAD` (empty/missing watermark → first-run seed; HEAD-behind → refuse) also produce an empty range but are NOT "already synced" — each is handled by its own branch outcome above, not by this terminal.

Doc-commit loop-breaker: exclude `llmdoc/` from the "is there source work?" test. If `git diff --name-only "$RANGE_BASE".."$H" -- ':(exclude)llmdoc/**'` is empty (range non-empty but doc-only), fast-forward the watermark to HEAD with zero doc work. Always exclude the sync file and `.llmdoc-tmp/` from every diff so a run never self-triggers.

Content selection: `recorder` reads committed-batch file content at the BATCH TIP (`git show <tip>:<path>`), never from HEAD/disk, except for the uncommitted working-tree set (read from disk, which wins for any currently-dirty path).

## Mode Selection

Choose the lightest mode that can keep the docs correct. The trigger is range size × authorship × risk (not context freshness).

- `fast`: small range (≤ ~3 commits), self-authored, impacted docs nameable. `--working-tree-only` defaults here. Skip mandatory investigation; update stable docs from the task summary, diff, targeted checks, and any still-valid scratch reports.
- `analysis`: ~4–15 commits, OR any non-self-authored commit, OR multiple clusters, OR a recovered/derived/first-run baseline. Use one focused `investigator` pass with `sink=file`, then `recorder`.
- `full`: > ~15 commits, multi-batch backfill, history-rewrite recovery, disputed facts, or failure-heavy tasks. Use investigator and recorder as separate roles.

Hard floors (always force ≥ `analysis`): a merge-base-recovered baseline, a derived/first-run baseline, or any non-self-authored commit. Backfill blast-radius cap: a first-run/`--since` range beyond ~20 commits or ~50 files forces `full` and explicit user confirmation. Thresholds are tunable defaults; report the chosen mode and the signals that triggered it.

Self-authored test: a commit is self-authored when its author email (`git log -1 --format=%ae <sha>`) equals the current `git config user.email`. If the identity cannot be determined (e.g., a subagent with no git identity, or `user.email` unset), treat commits as non-self-authored — the conservative side that forces ≥ `analysis`.

## `.llmdoc-tmp/`

`.llmdoc-tmp/` is a local temporary context cache, not stable project memory.

- Investigator reports may be retained across sessions under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/`.
- They are ignored by git, not indexed by `llmdoc/index.md`, and may be deleted at any time.
- Reuse them only after checking their recorded git revision, resolved range, scope, and unresolved gaps against the current repository.
- Promote only durable conclusions into tracked `llmdoc/` docs.
- Cleanup is active, not just permitted: this command garbage-collects consumed reports as part of a successful watermark advance (see the terminal step).

## Actions

1. Rebuild task context.
   - Read `llmdoc/index.md`, `llmdoc/startup.md`, and the MUST docs it lists.
   - Proactively read relevant `llmdoc/guides/` and the open entries in `llmdoc/memory/doc-gaps.md` before planning edits.
   - Note any explicit change summary from `$ARGUMENTS`.

2. Resolve sync state and compute the change set.
   - Run the resolution ladder above; parse batch flags; union batch impact sets with the working-tree set; apply the loop-breaker.
   - Handle degraded cases (non-git, shallow-below-boundary, first-run, orphaned, diverged, HEAD-behind) per the ladder; never fabricate a watermark advance on a degraded run.

3. Select the update mode from range size × authorship × risk. Honor the hard floors and the backfill cap.

4. Investigate only when the selected mode needs it.
   - Seed the investigator with the resolved net-diff path list. Persist one scratch report under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/` recording the resolved `RANGE_BASE..H` range.
   - Prefer targeted questions over broad repo scans.

5. Triage process signals before updating stable docs.
   - Collect the signals while they are fresh: worker `Process Signals` handoffs, doc defects reported by `/llmdoc:review`, failed commands or tests, user corrections, rework, and doc claims contradicted by evidence.
   - Route every signal to exactly one exit:
     - **fix now**: the signal traces to a stable-doc defect (wrong claim, missing routing, ambiguous contract) that is verifiable against the current repository — fold the fix into step 6.
     - **doc-gap**: real but not fixable in this run — add an actionable entry with closure criteria to `llmdoc/memory/doc-gaps.md`.
     - **discard**: not attributable to a verifiable doc defect — treat as noise.
   - Never write narrative memory files. Unverifiable process narratives do not belong anywhere under `llmdoc/`.
   - Routine `fast` updates with no signals skip this step.

6. Update stable llmdoc with `recorder`.
   - Update only the impacted docs, against the batch-tip state.
   - Remove or correct stable-doc claims that no longer match the current code.
   - Split documents aggressively instead of appending to a large file.
   - Reconcile `llmdoc/memory/doc-gaps.md`: close resolved gaps, mark stale gaps, add only actionable new gaps with closure criteria.
   - Keep the cold-start pack (`index.md` + `startup.md` + `must/`) under 24 KiB by default. In a monolith, preserve a small L0 root router and route leaf docs through subsystem indexes.

7. Synchronize `llmdoc/index.md`.
   - Ensure new and changed docs are discoverable.
   - Do not grow the root index into a monolith-wide leaf inventory; point it at subsystem indexes when direct enumeration would violate the startup budget.
   - Do not index `.llmdoc-tmp/`, and do not index `llmdoc/state/sync.md` as knowledge.

8. Advance the watermark (recorder-owned terminal step).
   - Safe-to-advance gate — ALL must hold: the update completed successfully and consumed a committed range; HEAD is attached (`git symbolic-ref -q HEAD` succeeds); and no git operation is in progress. Test the last one by whether the resolved path EXISTS on disk (`git rev-parse --git-path` always prints a path and exits 0 regardless of existence, so check with `[ -f ]`/`[ -d ]`): none of `[ -f "$(git rev-parse --git-path MERGE_HEAD)" ]`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, `REVERT_HEAD`, `[ -d "$(git rev-parse --git-path rebase-merge)" ]`, `rebase-apply` may exist.
   - If the gate holds, advance `watermark-commit` to the captured `H` (default) or the highest unbroken-prefix tip (partial/batch). Rewrite ONLY these fields, keeping the exact `- watermark-commit: ` line prefix (the reader anchors on it — do not reformat it):
     - `watermark-commit`: the new full commit SHA
     - `watermark-subject`: `git log -1 --format=%s <new-sha>`
     - `updated-at`: ISO-8601 UTC, e.g. `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`
     - `updated-by`: `/llmdoc:update`
   - NEVER advance on a `--working-tree-only` run, a failed/partial run, a HEAD-behind-watermark run, or when the safe-to-advance gate fails.
   - After a successful advance, garbage-collect `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/`: delete every scratch report whose recorded `Range:` tip is an ancestor of the new watermark (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <tip> <new-watermark>`) — its evidence has been consumed. Also delete reports whose recorded revision no longer exists in the repository. Skip GC entirely on runs that did not advance. Git never tracked these files, so deletion is final and safe.

9. Report the mode used, resolved range(s)/batches and commit count, old → new watermark (or why it did not move), any scratch report path, the signal triage outcome (fixed / doc-gap / discarded), the tmp-GC outcome (reports deleted or GC skipped), and the stable docs that changed.
