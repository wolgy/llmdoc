# /llmdoc:init

Use this command to initialize `llmdoc/` for a project, or to re-bootstrap an incomplete llmdoc tree.

Before executing the workflow, load the `llmdoc` skill.

Why:

- the skill defines the docs-first operating model
- the skill explains the recommended llmdoc structure and templates
- this command should focus on orchestration, not duplicate the full methodology

## Actions

1. Inspect the project root.
   - Read top-level manifests and README files.
   - Avoid dependency and build directories.

2. Create or repair the llmdoc skeleton.
   - Ensure these directories exist:
     - `llmdoc/startup.md`
     - `llmdoc/must/`
     - `llmdoc/overview/`
     - `llmdoc/architecture/`
     - `llmdoc/guides/`
     - `llmdoc/reference/`
     - `llmdoc/memory/doc-gaps.md`
     - `llmdoc/state/sync.md`
     - `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/`
   - Seed the commit watermark in `llmdoc/state/sync.md` (template in `skills/llmdoc/references/templates.md`): set `watermark-commit` to `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`, so the first `/llmdoc:update` has a valid anchor. Skip this in a non-git project. `llmdoc/state/sync.md` is machine-managed state, not knowledge: never index it or add it to `startup.md`/`must/`.
   - When re-bootstrapping an existing tree, delete scratch reports under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/` that are stale by their own metadata (recorded revision missing from the repository, or reuse conditions no longer met). Git never tracked them; deletion is final and safe.
3. Run investigation.
   - Use `investigator` for evidence gathering.
   - Default to multiple focused investigators instead of one broad investigator pass.
   - On most non-trivial repositories, start with 3-5 parallel investigators.
   - Bias toward coverage, not just speed. `init` should leave a reusable retrieval map, not only enough facts to draft a first document set.
   - Split by theme, not by random directories. Good slices include repo shape and entrypoints, runtime architecture, feature areas, tests and quality signals, and delivery or ops surfaces when present.
   - Explicitly cover the major repo surfaces that exist. At minimum, consider public interface docs, command contracts, agent prompts, runtime or tool configuration, quality signals, and integration surfaces.
   - Prefer `depth=deep` for the core investigation slices. Use `depth=quick` only for clearly secondary slices.
   - Persist reports under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/`.
   - Do not wait for the repository to be "large enough" before splitting. Split whenever doing so will produce better coverage or clearer retrieval maps.
   - After the first wave, run at least one follow-up investigation pass to resolve gaps, conflicts, and cross-cutting relationships discovered by the initial investigators.
   - Before handing off to `recorder`, consolidate what was covered, what was intentionally skipped, and what remains uncertain. Missing evidence should become an explicit gap, not a silent omission.
   - Treat these reports as scratch artifacts for bootstrapping, not stable project memory.

4. Generate the initial stable docs with `recorder`.
   - `recorder` should directly read the relevant raw investigation reports under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/` before writing stable docs. Do not rely only on second-hand summaries from the coordinating assistant.
   - Synthesize across all investigation reports, not just the first one that looks complete.
   - Treat uncovered major areas as documentation gaps to record, not as proof that those areas do not matter.
   - Create `llmdoc/index.md` as the global documentation map.
   - Create `llmdoc/startup.md`.
   - Create a small set of MUST docs for recurring startup context.
   - Treat the startup pack as a cold-start-only package; context compaction must resume from preserved task state instead of replaying it.
   - Keep `index.md` + `startup.md` + `must/` under 24 KiB by default. For a monolith, make the root index an L0 router and add subsystem indexes rather than listing every leaf document.
   - Ensure `llmdoc/index.md` does not duplicate the ordered startup list in `llmdoc/startup.md`.
   - Ensure `llmdoc/startup.md` does not duplicate the global category catalog from `llmdoc/index.md`.
   - Create `llmdoc/overview/project-overview.md`.
   - In the first stable pass, prioritize 2-3 core architecture or reference docs that capture the system's deepest invariants, flows, and contracts. Do not spread the first pass across many shallow documents.
   - Create focused architecture and reference docs based on the investigation reports, then expand into additional smaller docs only after the core docs are deep enough to stand on their own.
   - Treat document length as a quality tradeoff, not a hard limit. If a core doc needs more space to preserve causal flow, invariants, and terminology, keep it cohesive before splitting.

5. Synchronize `llmdoc/index.md`.
   - In a small repository, index stable docs directly. In a monolith, index subsystem routers and let those indexes route to leaf documents.
   - Keep `memory/doc-gaps.md` as the only file under `llmdoc/memory/`; store no narrative process memory.
   - Do not treat `.llmdoc-tmp/` as part of llmdoc.

6. Summarize what was created and where the main startup docs live.
